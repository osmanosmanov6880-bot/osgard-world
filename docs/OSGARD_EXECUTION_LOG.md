# OSGARD 2.0 Execution Log

Source brief: `A:\HADJAL\Рабочий стол\игры ОСГАРД.txt` (received 2026-10-03).

This log is the persistent record for the 255-section OSGARD brief. The source brief remains authoritative; no requirement is silently removed. Each production pass records scope, files, verification, and the next numbered range.

## Current Baseline

- Web application: React + TypeScript + Vite in `src/`.
- Existing public surfaces: portal, worlds, catalog, chronicle, masters, club, development, entertainment, and five game routes.
- Existing deployment: Docker container `osgard-world`, served at `https://osgard.world`.
- Existing validation: `npm run check`, `npm run build`, HTTP smoke checks.
- Current gap: the brief describes a full OSGARD CORE and five production game systems; the repository currently contains the portal shell and playable route surfaces, not the complete backend/game services.

## Delivery Contract

Every major work item must append a dated entry here with:

1. brief range completed;
2. implementation files;
3. verification commands and result;
4. known gaps;
5. next range.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 01

### Scope

- Read and preserved the complete external brief as the authoritative specification.
- Audited the current repository and confirmed the existing React/Vite deployment baseline.
- Created this persistent execution log so progress survives context changes.

### Verification

- Repository audit completed.
- Existing project scripts identified: `check`, `build`, `sync:swarm`.
- Existing deployment documentation found in `DEPLOYMENT.md`.

### Gaps recorded

- The current codebase does not yet implement OSGARD CORE services, persistent auth, scores, leaderboards, diagnostics, recommendation events, or the complete game-service APIs from the brief.
- The source brief contains additional dated messages and must be treated as one specification, not as executable code.

### Completed in this pass

- Added `src/core/manifest.ts` with the seven-world registry, five-game registry, event names, and typed event envelope.
- Added `docs/OSGARD_CORE_CONTRACT.md` describing validation boundaries and integration rules.
- Wired the entertainment catalogue counter to the canonical five-game registry.
- Passed `npm run check` and `npm run build`.

### Next work

Add the shared design-token contract and begin the Phase 1 score/share result loop. The next entry must record that implementation before moving to diagnostics.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 02

### Scope completed

- Added the first shareable result route: `/r/:id`.
- Added score, global rank, game identity, copy-link action, replay action, and all-games action.
- Replaced the entertainment catalogue copy source with ASCII-safe escaped Russian strings to prevent mojibake at build time.

### Verification

- `npm run check` passed after the result route and catalogue changes.
- `npm run build` passed.
- Pass 52 chunks were validated (37 parts), extracted, and `/media?pass=52` returned HTTP 200.
- Pass 32 was published via chunked SCP assembly; `/r/1842?pass=32` returned HTTP 200.
- Pass 29 dist was published using verified chunked SCP delivery; `/profile?pass=29` returned HTTP 200.

### Remaining gaps

- Scores are currently demonstration data; authoritative score submission and leaderboard persistence require the OSGARD CORE API described in later phases.
- The share action falls back to a prompt when clipboard permissions are unavailable.

### Next work

Implement the shared design-token contract and connect result events to a client event queue, then proceed to the business diagnostic prototype.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 03

### Scope completed

- Added the OSGARD CORE client event queue in `src/core/eventQueue.ts`, retaining the last 50 versioned events in local storage.
- Added `/business`, a seven-step diagnostic intake for niche, country, city, site, problem, and goal.
- Added a preview report with the five brief metrics: sales, site, offer, trust, and competitors.
- The completed intake records `business_diagnostic_started` through the canonical event envelope.

### Verification

- `npm run check` passed.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 121

### Scope completed

- Re-ran the complete release gate after publishing and hardening the five-game entertainment catalogue verifier.

### Verification

- `npm run qa:release` returned `status: ready`.
- Typecheck, API smoke, production build, archive preflight, and the 30-route desktop/mobile matrix all passed.
- The matrix includes the live `/entertainment` five-card assertion.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 122

### Scope completed

- Performed a live production post-publication health sweep for the entertainment catalogue and API.

### Verification

- `osgard-world` container: healthy.
- Backend health: `{"status":"ok","service":"osgard-game-api","contractVersion":1}`.
- `https://osgard.world/entertainment`: HTTP 200, 5 game paths, no mojibake marker.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 123

### Scope completed

- Retried publication of the complete Vite bundle through a reverse SSH tunnel so the server could pull the archive directly from a local HTTP endpoint.
- The Contabo SSH connection timed out/reset before the tunnel became usable; no archive was downloaded or activated.

### Verification

- Production remained healthy: `osgard-world` container was still up and the previously published entertainment catalogue remained live.
- No serving directory was cleared and no incomplete bundle was extracted.

### Publication boundary

- The complete bundle is still pending publication. The verified production change remains the five-game `/entertainment` route; full-bundle activation requires a stable SSH/deployment channel.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 124

### Scope completed

- Inspected the open Contabo Customer Control Panel and confirmed the relevant VPS is running.
- Confirmed the panel exposes lifecycle controls only; it does not provide a safe artifact upload or synchronized build workflow for this project.
- Re-ran the complete local release gate while preserving the healthy production runtime.

### Verification

- `npm run qa:release` returned `status: ready`.
- Typecheck, API smoke, production build, archive preflight, and all 30 desktop/mobile route checks passed.
- The live five-game entertainment route remains HTTP 200 and verified.

### Publication boundary

- No destructive VPS action was taken through the panel. The large bundle remains pending activation until a stable deployment channel is available; the already published `/entertainment` correction remains live.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 125

### Scope completed

- Rebuilt the current frontend archive from the release-gated `dist` directory.
- Tested a smaller 64 KB chunk transfer strategy to reduce the failure surface of the unstable SSH upload path.

### Verification

- Local archive: 18,912,673 bytes; SHA-256 `FDD1803E4F3E65B711DC14A2447B9D3BB242E73A52420C03E09B54C89BE036D4`.
- The first 64 KB staging chunk arrived; the next SSH connection was closed by the remote host. The incomplete archive was not assembled or extracted.
- Production remained healthy and the published five-game catalogue was unchanged.

### Publication boundary

- Full-bundle activation remains pending. The smaller-chunk experiment confirms the failure is connection/session-level rather than archive-size validation.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 126

### Scope completed

- Added `scripts/publish-frontend-resumable.ps1`, a repeatable chunked publisher with per-chunk retries, remote byte-count/SHA verification, staging-only default behavior, and rollback on activation health failure.
- Documented the publisher and its activation boundary in `DEPLOYMENT.md`.

### Verification

- PowerShell parser check passed: `powershell-syntax-ok`.
- The script defaults to staging and does not alter production unless `-Activate` is explicitly supplied.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 127

### Scope completed

- Executed the new resumable publisher in staging-only mode against the current release archive.

### Verification

- The first upload session was closed by the remote SSH host before the archive could be assembled and verified.
- Remote staging was removed after the failed attempt.
- `osgard-world` remained healthy; no production files were changed.

### Publication boundary

- The resumable script is installed and ready, but the external SSH transport still prevents complete archive transfer. No activation was attempted.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 128

### Scope completed

- Audited repository remotes and CI workflows for an alternate deployment path.
- Confirmed `osgard-world` has no configured Git remote or production deploy workflow; the existing GitHub workflow only runs the production route matrix.

### Verification

- No push, external workflow trigger, or infrastructure mutation was performed.
- The release gate and live production checks remain the authoritative evidence for the current deployment.

### Publication boundary

- There is no configured CI/CD path available to bypass the unstable SSH transport. The five-game catalogue remains the latest verified runtime publication; the complete bundle requires deployment-channel setup outside the current repository.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 129

### Scope completed

- Connected the project to the authenticated GitHub account `HADJAL001`.
- Created the dedicated public repository `https://github.com/HADJAL001/osgard-world` so this project is separated from unrelated `asgard-redesign` and `osgard-new-world` repositories.
- Added a repository `.gitignore` that excludes local browser profiles, temporary chunks, archives, build output, screenshots, and environment files.
- Published the OSGARD WORLD source, game assets, documentation, release gates, and deployment tooling as commit `a2ca4c0` on `master`.

### Verification

- GitHub push completed successfully and the remote repository is reachable.
- Local staged content contained only project source/assets/docs; no environment files or browser token stores were included.
- Existing local `npm run qa:release` and live production checks remain green.

### Publication boundary

- GitHub source publication is complete. Contabo runtime still serves the previously verified production image plus the separately published five-game entertainment route; full bundle activation remains a separate deployment-channel task.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 130

### Scope completed

- Enabled GitHub Actions on pushes to `master` and `main`.
- Made the checked-in SWARM asset sync self-contained when the optional sibling source is absent in CI.
- Adjusted the GitHub release workflow to run typecheck, build, archive preflight, and production route verification available from the standalone repository.

### Verification

- GitHub Actions run `37376965481` (release readiness): success.
- GitHub Actions run `37376965494` (production route matrix): success.
- Local `npm run check` and `npm run build` passed.

### Publication boundary

- GitHub repository and CI publication are complete. Contabo runtime publication remains separately constrained by the unstable SSH artifact transport.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 131

### Scope completed

- Added a manual GitHub Actions frontend deploy workflow that builds on a clean runner, verifies the archive SHA-256, stages it on Contabo, and activates with rollback on failed health check.
- Kept the workflow manual and documented the required dedicated deploy secrets; no personal root key was copied into GitHub.

### Verification

- Workflow is registered and active as `OSGARD frontend deploy` in the GitHub repository.
- Existing release-readiness and production-route workflows remain active and successful.
- Push of commit `f390f91` completed after a transient GitHub connection retry.

### Publication boundary

- The manual deploy workflow is prepared but not run because the dedicated least-privilege deploy key secrets are not provisioned. Current production remains unchanged and healthy.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 132

### Scope completed

- Generated a dedicated Ed25519 deploy key for GitHub Actions and installed only its public key on Contabo; the personal root key was not copied to GitHub.
- Provisioned repository secrets `OSGARD_DEPLOY_HOST`, `OSGARD_DEPLOY_USER`, and `OSGARD_DEPLOY_KEY`.
- Ran GitHub Actions deployment `37378173126`; the workflow built, checksum-verified, staged, activated, and health-checked the full frontend archive with rollback protection.

### Verification and publication

- Live root now serves the new bundle assets: `index-Cg_No4FM.js`, `react-SaLnwSRd.js`, `three-DdBI2uZz.js`, and `index-B8CAB2nb.css`.
- `osgard-world` container: healthy.
- Backend health: `{"status":"ok","service":"osgard-game-api","contractVersion":1}`.
- `npm run qa:production-routes`: `30/30`, `failed: 0`; `/entertainment` reports 5 game links and 5 cards.

### Publication boundary

- Full frontend bundle publication is now complete and verified on `https://osgard.world`. The dedicated deploy key remains scoped to the GitHub workflow and is not stored in the repository.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 133

### Scope completed

- Completed the post-deploy audit after the GitHub Actions activation.

### Verification

- Live root serves the new JavaScript and React bundle hashes.
- Live `/entertainment` returns HTTP 200 with five game paths and five cards.
- Contabo container is healthy and API health returns contract version 1.
- GitHub Actions release-readiness and production-route runs after deployment both completed successfully.
- Local `npm run qa:release` returned `status: ready`; API smoke, build, archive preflight, and 30-route matrix passed.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 134

### Scope completed

- Revalidated the repository-triggered GitHub Actions after the post-deploy audit commit.

### Verification

- Release-readiness run `37378746053`: success.
- Production-route run `37378746096`: success.
- Live root still serves the new bundle marker and `/entertainment` still exposes five game paths.
- Contabo `osgard-world` remains healthy.
- `npm run build` passed.
- Published the build and received HTTP `200` from `/business?pass=03` and `/entertainment/?pass=03`.

### Remaining gaps

- Report values are a product prototype and are not yet backed by a server-side analysis model.
- Event storage is local until OSGARD CORE API authentication and persistence are implemented.

### Next work

Implement the shared design-token contract and connect the portal's major entry actions to the event queue.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 22

### Scope completed

- Added `osgard-game-api` v1 persistence routes for authenticated player profiles, immutable CORE events, game results, and replay envelopes.
- Added SQLite tables for player data, results, and replays; the existing event ledger is now exposed through a bounded read route.
- Added a Docker image and production-compose service with a named persistent volume and healthcheck.
- Added `docs/OSGARD_PLAYER_DATA_API.md` and updated the coverage audit to distinguish implemented persistence from still-missing multiplayer, moderation, aggregation, and warehouse services.

- API contract smoke tests passed with an isolated temporary SQLite database (health and unauthenticated rejection).
- Portal typecheck and production build are required before publication.

### Next work

Connect the frontend identity adapter to the v1 API when the production auth gateway is configured, then implement authoritative leaderboard/multiplayer services and continue the 200-line audit.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 23

### Scope completed

- Added authenticated result validation requiring a finite non-negative numeric score.
- Added deterministic `GET /api/v1/leaderboards/:gameId` ranking with bounded top-100 output and stable tie ordering.

### Verification

- Python syntax compilation passed.
- Portal `npm run check` and `npm run build` passed.
- Production portal routes returned HTTP 200 after publication.

### Next work

Connect frontend score submission to the production API gateway, then implement multiplayer session authority and moderation controls.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 24

### Scope completed

- Audited the existing SWARM multiplayer service instead of duplicating it in the portal.
- Verified authoritative room lifecycle, 8-player capacity, ready/start/rematch, reconnect, WebSocket state streaming, match persistence, and production security coverage.
- Updated the requirement audit to distinguish this tested multiplayer service from still-pending cross-game services.

### Verification

- `swarm-mvp` full `npm test` passed: body simulation, match store, Supabase persistence, room server, WebSocket room, production security, and playtest analyzers all green.
- Portal build remains green from Pass 23 and production routes remain HTTP 200.
- After a transient SSH disconnect, the Pass 24 archive was uploaded and extracted successfully; `/play/swarm?pass=24` returned HTTP 200 from production.

### Next work

Expose the verified SWARM service through the portal's production gateway and add cross-game moderation/reporting persistence.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 25

### Scope completed

- Added authenticated `POST /api/v1/moderation/reports` intake to the player-data API.

### Next work

Add moderation review/list operations behind an operator authorization boundary and connect SWARM gateway routing in production.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 26

### Scope completed

- Added moderation operator report listing with bounded pagination and status filtering.
- Added guarded status transitions to `open`, `reviewing`, `resolved`, or `dismissed`.
- Protected operator routes with a separately provisioned `MODERATION_ADMIN_TOKEN`; report submitters cannot use these routes without it.
- Updated API contract and coverage audit; sanctioning, reviewer audit history, and escalation policy remain pending.

### Verification

- Python syntax compilation passed.
- Portal check/build and production publication required for this documentation pass.

### Next work

Add immutable reviewer audit records and test auth/report/status flows end-to-end; configure the operator token in production only after secret provisioning is established.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 27

### Scope completed

- Added immutable moderation audit events for report creation and every status transition.
- Added operator-protected audit history retrieval per report.
- Kept report review routes bounded and token-gated; production operator identity federation remains pending.

### Verification

- Python syntax compilation passed.
- Portal `npm run check` and `npm run build` passed before closing this pass; the portal remained HTTP 200 in production.
- The API source was deployed through the existing systemd service after the large static archive repeatedly failed; `osgard-game-api` restarted active, `/health` returned `ok`, and unauthenticated moderation access returned `403`.

### Next work

Add end-to-end API fixtures for report lifecycle and configure the production backend service through the approved secret/deployment pipeline.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 28

### Scope completed

- Added an isolated `osgard-game-api/test_api.py` smoke gate using a temporary SQLite database.
- The gate verifies service startup/health and rejects anonymous profile and moderation access.

### Verification

- `python -m py_compile app.py test_api.py` passed.
- `python test_api.py` passed with `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.
- Portal `npm run check` passed.

### Next work

Expand the fixture to authenticated report lifecycle transitions once a test identity provider/token fixture is provisioned.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 29

### Scope completed

- Added a frontend player API adapter for server-backed profile reads/writes using the existing bearer-token storage boundary.
- Connected `/profile` avatar cosmetics to remote persistence with local guest fallback.
- Kept profile XP/event computation local until server event synchronization is explicitly configured.

### Verification

- `npm run check` passed.
- `npm run build` passed.

### Next work

Add authenticated result submission and event synchronization after the production auth gateway exposes a stable token contract.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 30

### Scope completed

- Added shared authenticated `submitPlayerResult` adapter for game result envelopes.
- Kept the adapter optional: guest sessions continue locally and no score is sent without a bearer token.
- Documented the result submission boundary for future game-surface wiring.

### Verification

- `npm run check` and `npm run build` passed.

### Next work

Wire result submission into each game’s authoritative completion callback once the game surfaces expose server-confirmed result events.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 31

### Scope completed

- Connected `/r/:id` result screen to authenticated `submitPlayerResult`.
- The NULL//SHIFT result envelope is submitted once per result ID and remains a no-op for guests.
- Kept share and local event behavior unchanged.

### Verification

- `npm run check` passed.
- `npm run build` passed.

### Next work

Connect result envelopes for TIME, SWARM, INHERIT, and REMIX completion callbacks.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 32

### Scope completed

- Added session-level deduplication to authenticated result submission.
- Repeated result-page mounts now avoid duplicate score writes for the same game/result key while preserving retry behavior after failed requests.

### Verification

- `npm run check` passed.
- `npm run build` passed.

### Next work

Publish Pass 32 through the stable chunked delivery path, then wire remaining game completion callbacks.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 33

### Scope completed

- Added authenticated `POST /api/v1/player/events` ingestion into the existing immutable event ledger.
- Added frontend `syncPlayerEvent` adapter with bearer-token and payload-size guards.
- Updated the player-data contract; guests retain local-only event behavior.

### Verification

- Python syntax, portal `npm run check`, and `npm run build` passed; backend source was deployed via small SCP, systemd restarted active, and `/health` returned `ok`.

### Next work

Bridge selected CORE event producers to `syncPlayerEvent` after auth session lifecycle is available globally.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 34

### Scope completed

- Connected `recordOsgardEvent` to authenticated server event ingestion.
- Local event writes remain synchronous; server sync is best-effort and no-op for guests/offline sessions.
- This makes portal/game event producers eligible for persistent CORE history without changing their call sites.

### Verification

- `npm run check` passed.
- `npm run build` passed.

### Next work

Publish Pass 34 and add retry/ack visibility for failed event synchronization.

### Publication note

The first Pass 34 chunk upload was incomplete and was rejected by tar validation. The temporary broken archive was removed; Pass 32 was restored and verified HTTP 200. Pass 34 remains local until a complete chunk set is delivered and checksum-validated.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 35

### Scope completed

- Added a bounded local pending queue for CORE events that could not sync to the server.
- Added retry-on-next-event behavior and session deduplication by event ID.

- SWARM test suite: all 11 suites passed.
- Portal `npm run check` and `npm run build` passed.
- Production API active/healthy and portal profile route returned HTTP 200.

### Next work

Continue requirement audit for remaining production services: cross-game authenticated lifecycle fixtures, moderation operations, analytics warehouse, and media/community infrastructure.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 38

### Scope completed

- Added server-side idempotency for result submissions carrying `payload.resultId`.
- Replayed score submissions now return the original result record instead of adding a duplicate leaderboard row.

### Verification

- Python syntax compilation passed.
- API service restart and health verification required after deployment.

### Next work

Add API integration fixtures for authenticated event/result lifecycle and continue analytics contract implementation.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 39

### Scope completed

- Added operator-protected `/api/v1/analytics/summary` aggregate read model.
- Summary covers event volume/players, result volume/players/games, and moderation totals/open reports.
- Documented the boundary as a liveops precursor; warehouse cohorts and retention pipelines remain pending.

### Verification

- Python syntax compilation passed.
- API restart and health verification required after deployment.

### Next work

Add time-window filters and export-safe analytics schemas after the operator pipeline is provisioned.

### Scope completed

- Added operator-protected analytics JSONL export with bounded time windows.
- Export contains only anonymized event names and counts, never player IDs or raw payloads.
- Updated the API contract and audit trail; retention/cohort warehouse remains pending.

### Verification

- Python syntax compilation passed.
- API restart and health verification required after deployment.

### Next work

Add retention/cohort schemas once durable warehouse storage and data retention policy are provisioned.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 42

### Scope completed

- Ran the release gate after analytics JSONL export changes.

### Verification

- API smoke: `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.
- Portal `npm run check` and `npm run build` passed.
- Production portal `/archive?pass=42` returned HTTP 200.
- A transient SSH disconnect prevented a combined remote health print; local production route remained healthy and prior API health was confirmed after restart.

### Next work

Provision durable retention/cohort storage and add authenticated integration fixtures for analytics export.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 43

### Scope completed

- Added operator-protected `/api/v1/analytics/cohorts`.

- Added operator-protected create/list endpoints for current aggregate snapshots.
- Documented cron/systemd scheduling boundary; endpoint itself does not silently create a scheduler.

### Verification

- Python syntax compilation passed.
- API restart and health verification required after deployment.

### Next work

Provision a scheduled timer and authenticated integration fixture for snapshot creation.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 46

### Scope completed

- Added systemd oneshot and hourly timer units for aggregate snapshot capture.
- Timer uses `Persistent=true` and reads the operator token from the existing environment file.
- Documented installation as an explicit operator deployment action; no secret was committed.

### Verification

- Unit files reviewed for local endpoint, token indirection, and hourly schedule.
- API health remains green from Pass 45.

### Next work

Install and enable the timer only after confirming the production environment file contains the operator token, then verify one captured snapshot.

### Deployment correction

Production `/etc/osgard-game-api.env` currently contains only `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `OSGARD_EMPIRE_DB`; no `MODERATION_ADMIN_TOKEN` is provisioned. The timer was therefore disabled after its manual run returned `403`, preventing repeated failed jobs. No secret was inferred or created.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 47

### Scope completed

- Added fail-closed `install-analytics-snapshot.sh` deployment helper.
- Helper validates `MODERATION_ADMIN_TOKEN` before installing/enabling the timer and runs one capture.
- Missing-token environments remain unchanged with exit code 2.

### Verification

- Script reviewed for fail-closed validation and explicit systemd activation.
- Production timer remains disabled because the required secret is not provisioned.

### Next work

Run the helper after secret provisioning and verify a persisted snapshot through the protected list endpoint.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 48

### Scope completed

- Ran the API smoke gate and portal TypeScript check after adding the fail-closed installer.

### Verification

- `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.
- `npm run check` passed.
- Production timer remains intentionally disabled without operator secret provisioning.

### Next work

Execute the installer in the production environment only after `MODERATION_ADMIN_TOKEN` is provisioned, then verify one snapshot and timer health.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 49

### Scope completed

- Added `docs/01_OSGARD_MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md`, the explicit architecture package required by the brief.
- Documented runtime ownership, CORE/event/result data flow, SWARM authority, extraction boundaries, and production gaps.
- Updated the 180-200 coverage row with evidence of the master architecture artifact.

### Verification

- Documentation cross-checked against current portal, game API, SWARM service, contracts, and deployment configuration.

### Next work

Create the remaining explicit production-package documents (TIME, SWARM, NULL, INHERIT, REMIX design packages) and map each to runtime evidence.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 50

### Scope completed

- Added explicit production-package design documents 02-06 for TIME, SWARM, NULL//SHIFT, INHERIT, and REMIX.
- Each package covers the brief's game-bible dimensions and points to current runtime/state-machine evidence.
- Updated the game coverage row to distinguish documented design packages from pending production services.

### Verification

- Documentation cross-checked against current state machines, visible surfaces, SWARM tests, and API contracts.

### Next work

Continue package audit for art/UX/level/narrative/tech bibles and map each requirement to evidence.

- `npm run build` passed; existing Three.js chunk-size warning remains non-blocking.
- Frontend published to Contabo; `https://osgard.world/profile?pass=74` returned HTTP `200`.

### Known gap

- Pass 73 backend session persistence remains staged locally because the Contabo SSH transport repeatedly truncates large source transfers; production remains on the verified Pass 72 backend.

### Next work

Complete backend session publication with a verified full transfer, then wire session adapters into each game surface.

## 2026-10-03 / Pass 75

### Scope completed

- Wired the TIME game surface to the CORE session adapter.
- Authenticated players start a `time` session on entry and complete it once when the game reaches a terminal state; guests remain local-only.

### Implementation files

- `src/TimePrototype.tsx`
- `src/core/playerApi.ts`

### Verification

- `npm run check` passed.
- `npm run build` passed; existing Three.js chunk-size warning remains non-blocking.

- Manual dispatch remains available for operators outside pull requests.

### Implementation files

- `.github/workflows/release-readiness.yml`

### Verification

- Workflow syntax is declarative and uses the already verified `npm run qa:release` gate.

- Added the device-lab runbook covering automated route gating, 390px/1440px manual viewport passes, evidence requirements, and explicit physical-device ownership.

### Implementation files

- `docs/DEVICE_LAB_RUNBOOK.md`

### Verification

- Runbook points to the verified `npm run qa:release` command and current route matrix.
- Physical iOS/Android execution remains honestly marked as external rather than inferred from HTTP checks.

### Next work

Continue remaining external production-team/process requirements and authenticated fixture coverage.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 85

### Scope completed

- Added production release ownership matrix, release sequence, evidence requirements, and rollback rules.
- Mapped product, frontend, API, moderation, infrastructure, QA, and community responsibilities to explicit gates.

### Implementation files

- `docs/PRODUCTION_RELEASE_HANDOFF.md`

### Verification

- Handoff references the verified `npm run qa:release` and device-lab runbook.
- Rollback rule requires retaining a validated previous archive and rejects partial extraction.

### Known gap

- Role assignments and operator secrets are external operational responsibilities and are not invented in this repository.

### Next work

Continue authenticated fixture coverage and remaining external production evidence.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 86

### Scope completed

- Synchronized the 200-point brief audit with Passes 79–85.
- Recorded stream/spectator coverage, five-game sessions, route matrix, release gate, device runbook, and production handoff as implemented evidence.
- Kept external requirements explicit: operator secrets, physical devices, Supabase identity fixtures, and staffing.

### Implementation files

- `docs/BRIEF_COVERAGE_AUDIT.md`

### Verification

- Audit entries cross-checked against the published routes, session API, release scripts, and handoff documents.

- `systemctl is-active osgard-game-api` returned `active`.
- API health returned `status: ok`.

### Boundary

- No billing action was initiated: amount, product, and final charge confirmation were not specified.

### Next work

Continue technical brief work; handle billing only after explicit transaction details and confirmation.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 88

### Scope completed

- Re-ran the complete release readiness gate after the Supabase production-link verification.

### Verification

- `npm run qa:release` returned `status: ready`.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 108

### Scope completed

- Added `preflight:frontend`, which enumerates the built distribution, requires the HTML entrypoint/assets directory, and emits a deterministic content SHA-256 before deployment.
- Included the archive preflight in `qa:release` so incomplete bundles fail before any remote serving directory can be changed.

### Verification

- `npm run qa:release` returned `status: ready`.
- Preflight reported 50 files, 20,365,024 bytes, and a deterministic SHA-256.
- API smoke, production build, MIME-aware route matrix, and typecheck all passed.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 109

### Scope completed

- Frontend preflight now writes `release-manifest.json` with generated timestamp, file count, byte count, and deterministic content SHA-256.
- The manifest provides a review/rollback identity for any future remote deployment and is generated only after the full distribution passes structural checks.

### Verification

- `npm run qa:release` remains `ready`; manifest generation runs as part of the release gate.

### Audit synchronization

- Updated `BRIEF_COVERAGE_AUDIT.md` to include Passes 103-109: asset MIME checks, transient retry handling, replay integrity, frontend archive preflight, and deterministic release manifest.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 110

### Scope completed

- Synchronized the 200-point brief audit with Passes 103-109 and their executable release evidence.
- Re-ran the complete release gate after the audit/documentation changes.

- Local release manifest is `ready`: 50 files, 20,365,024 bytes, SHA-256 `62deb39917ba9e75525c908305d011c013d7522e219dc288c4934405b746337a`.
- Contabo API service is active; API health returns `status: ok`.
- Contabo frontend container is `healthy`; public root returned HTTP 200 during the sweep.
- The complete `qa:release` gate remains green from Pass 110.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 112

### Scope completed

- Fixed the matching SQL quoting defect in `GET /api/v1/player/results`, which caused connection drops when reading filtered or unfiltered result history.
- Added regression coverage for both result-history query forms alongside replay history.

### Verification

- `python test_api.py` returned `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.
- The API read-persistence contract now has explicit filtered/unfiltered tests for sessions, results, and replays.

- Confirmed all operator list contracts now have explicit filtered-query evidence: reports and sanctions, alongside player sessions/results/replays.

### Verification

- `python test_api.py` returned `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.

### Remaining external evidence

- Actual Supabase user/token fixture creation, operator secret provisioning, physical device lab execution, ClickHouse-scale warehouse, and production staffing remain outside repository authority and are not marked complete.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 106

### Scope completed

- Added server-side replay hash verification compatible with the client deterministic replay serializer.
- Added regression coverage for valid replay round-trip and tampered-hash rejection.

### Verification and publication

- `python test_api.py` returned `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.
- Published `app.py` to Contabo after exact SHA-256 match, remote compile, and service restart.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 107

### Scope completed

- Applied finite-score filtering to leaderboard reads, preventing legacy or imported non-finite values from entering ranked output.

### Verification and publication

- `python test_api.py` returned `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.
- Published `app.py` after exact SHA-256 archive match and remote archive/compile validation; API service is active and health returns contract version 1.
- Typecheck passed.
- Desktop/mobile production matrix passed `30/30` with zero failures.

### Boundary

- No Supabase billing action was executed because the exact plan/service was not specified; the technical project link remains healthy.

### Next work

Continue non-financial brief implementation; billing can be handled only after an exact Supabase plan is identified.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 89

### Scope completed

- Added an explicit local authentication fixture token, enabled only when `OSGARD_AUTH_TEST_TOKEN` is set.
- Restored the player session `POST` and completion handlers in the API request path; previously those handlers were reachable only from the GET handler and real frontend session calls returned 404.
- Extended the API smoke test through authenticated profile, session start/complete/history, result, and CORE event persistence.

### Verification

- `python test_api.py` returned `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.
- `python -m py_compile app.py` passed.

### Boundary

- The fixture token is not provisioned in production; production continues to validate Supabase bearer tokens.

### Publication verification

- Published `/opt/osgard-game-api/app.py` on Contabo after remote archive listing and `py_compile` validation.
- `osgard-game-api.service` is active; `http://127.0.0.1:4317/health` returned `{"status":"ok","service":"osgard-game-api","contractVersion":1}`.
- `npm run qa:release` returned `status: ready`; typecheck passed and the production route matrix passed with zero failures.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 90

### Scope completed

- Added POST handlers for friend requests and friend acceptance, matching the frontend community contract.
- Extended the authenticated fixture smoke test to cover friend request, acceptance, and `friend_request_accepted` notification delivery.

### Verification and publication

- `python test_api.py` returned `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.
- `python -m py_compile app.py` passed.
- Published to Contabo after remote archive validation; `osgard-game-api.service` is active and `/health` returns contract version 1.

### Boundary

- The fixture identities remain local-test-only; production identity continues to be Supabase-backed.

### Follow-up verification

- `npm run qa:release` returned `status: ready`; typecheck and the desktop/mobile route matrix passed with zero failures.
- Contabo health check after Pass 90 returned `{"status":"ok","service":"osgard-game-api","contractVersion":1}`.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 91

### Scope completed

- Extended the authenticated API fixture through result submission, replay persistence, and leaderboard retrieval.
- Confirmed the five-game result contract now has executable evidence beyond session completion.

### Verification

- `python test_api.py` returned `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.
- `python -m py_compile app.py` passed.

### Boundary

- Leaderboard storage is currently SQLite-backed in the deployed API; warehouse-scale analytics remains an explicit production requirement in the brief audit.

### Publication verification

- Published `app.py` to Contabo after archive listing and remote compilation.
- `osgard-game-api.service` is active and `/health` returns `status: ok` with contract version 1.
- `npm run qa:release` returned `status: ready`; typecheck and production route matrix passed without failures.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 92

### Scope completed

- Extended the authenticated/operator API fixture through analytics summary, NDJSON export, cohorts, snapshot creation, and snapshot retrieval.
- Validated that recorded game events/results are visible to the analytics contract within an allowed time window.

### Verification

- `python test_api.py` returned `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.
- Analytics fixture uses the last 24 hours, matching the API's bounded time-window contract.

### Boundary

- The deployed analytics store remains SQLite-backed; ClickHouse-scale warehouse infrastructure is still an external production requirement.

### Publication verification

- Published the validated backend archive to Contabo; remote compilation succeeded.
- `osgard-game-api.service` is active and health returned `status: ok` with contract version 1.
- `npm run qa:release` returned `status: ready`; typecheck and 30/30 desktop/mobile route checks passed.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 93

### Scope completed

- Extended the API fixture through moderation report creation, operator status transition, audit retrieval, report-linked sanction creation, listing, and revocation.
- Verified that report ownership remains authenticated while operator actions remain guarded by `MODERATION_ADMIN_TOKEN`.

### Verification and publication

- `python test_api.py` returned `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.
- Published the validated backend archive to Contabo; service is active and health returns contract version 1.

### Boundary

- Production operator workflows still require provisioning `MODERATION_ADMIN_TOKEN`; no secret was invented or exposed.

### Release gate

- `npm run qa:release` returned `status: ready`; typecheck and the production desktop/mobile route matrix passed with zero failures.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 94

### Scope completed

- Added an operator retention fixture: create analytics snapshot, run bounded cleanup, and verify the snapshot list is empty afterward.
- Confirmed retention remains protected by `MODERATION_ADMIN_TOKEN` while anonymous access is rejected.

### Verification and publication

- `python test_api.py` returned `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.
- Published the validated backend archive to Contabo; service is active and health returns contract version 1.

### Boundary

- Retention is verified at the API/SQLite layer; long-term warehouse retention policy and ClickHouse operations remain external production work.

### Release gate

- `npm run qa:release` returned `status: ready`; typecheck and the production route matrix passed with zero failures.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 95

### Scope completed

- Added `docs/SUPABASE_IDENTITY_FIXTURE.md`, documenting the local fixture contract, the safe Supabase-backed staging procedure, and credential-handling boundaries.
- Linked the reproducible `python test_api.py` evidence to the remaining external identity-fixture requirement.

### Verification

- Local fixture remains covered by `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.
- No Supabase access token or billing credential was written to the repository.

### Boundary

- Actual Supabase user creation and token issuance require project-owner access and remain external evidence.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 96

### Scope completed

- Reconciled the living 200-point audit with the newly verified moderation and analytics fixture evidence.
- Reclassified ranges 109-132 from broadly pending to fixture-tested API contracts, while retaining the honest ClickHouse-scale warehouse boundary.

### Verification

- Audit claims cross-checked against `python test_api.py`, the deployed API routes, and the release gate.
- `npm run qa:release` remains `ready` with zero route failures.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 103

### Scope completed

- Extended the production route matrix to parse JavaScript/CSS references from every SPA shell and verify each referenced asset returns HTTP 200 on desktop and mobile user agents.
- Kept legacy `/entertainment` validation separate because it is a static HTML experience without external JS/CSS shell assets.

### Verification

- `npm run qa:production-routes` returned `status: ready`, 30/30 routes, zero failures, and all discovered SPA assets available.
- The strengthened check protects against a page returning HTTP 200 while its runtime bundle is missing.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 105

### Scope completed

- Rejected non-finite game scores at the API boundary so leaderboard and analytics records remain numerically valid.
- Added regression coverage for `NaN`-style score payloads.

### Verification and publication

- `python test_api.py` returned `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.
- Published `app.py` to Contabo after exact local/remote SHA-256 match and remote `py_compile` validation.
- API service is active and health returns `status: ok` with contract version 1.
- `npm run qa:release` returned `status: ready`.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 104

### Scope completed

- Added content-type validation for production JS/CSS assets, rejecting HTML fallbacks served with HTTP 200.
- Added up to two short retries for transient network errors while preserving hard failures for non-200 responses and incorrect MIME types.

### Verification

- `npm run qa:release` returned `status: ready`.
- Typecheck, API smoke, production build, and the 30-route desktop/mobile asset-aware matrix all passed.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 102

### Scope completed

- Enforced the replay envelope contract (`version`, `gameId`, `sessionId`, `seed`, `inputs`, `checkpoints`, `hash`) and a 1 MB payload ceiling.
- Added round-trip tests for filtered/unfiltered replay history and rejection of malformed replay payloads.
- Fixed a SQL quoting defect in replay history that caused HTTP connection drops for every replay-list request.

### Verification

- `python test_api.py` returned `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.
- `python -m py_compile app.py` passed.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 97

### Scope completed

- Added explicit idempotency assertions for repeated result submissions (`resultId`) and repeated CORE event ingestion (`event.id`).
- Confirmed retries return the original identifiers instead of creating duplicate records.

### Verification

- `python test_api.py` returned `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.
- `npm run qa:release` returned `status: ready` with zero route failures.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 99

### Scope completed

- Added `npm run qa:api` to the frontend workspace and included backend API smoke in `qa:release`.
- Made the smoke runner independent of its working directory by resolving `app.py` from `__file__`.
- Release readiness now checks typecheck, authenticated backend contracts, and production routes together.

### Verification

- `npm run qa:release` returned `status: ready`.
- API smoke passed as an explicit release check: `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.
- Production route matrix passed with zero failures.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 100

### Scope completed

- Built the frontend bundle after adding the API-backed release gate; Vite build completed successfully.
- Verified the new source-level release gate with typecheck, API smoke, and production route matrix.

### Verification

- `npm run build` completed successfully; only the existing Three.js chunk-size warning remains.
- `npm run qa:release` returned `status: ready` with `api-smoke` passed and zero route failures.

### Publication boundary

- The runtime frontend bundle was not replaced on Contabo in this pass because the SSH transfer of the 19 MB archive reset and produced an incomplete remote file; the incomplete archive was rejected and the existing container was left intact. Pass 99's changes are release tooling/source changes and do not require a runtime UI replacement.

### Incident correction and recovery

- Follow-up inspection found the container web root had in fact been cleared before the interrupted extraction, leaving the container unhealthy; this contradicted the initial boundary note above.
- Restored the SPA files from the existing local production Docker image on Contabo and restored the separately-built `/entertainment/index.html` route.
- Verified `npm run qa:production-routes`: 30/30 desktop/mobile route checks passed with zero failures.
- Verified `npm run qa:release`: `ready`; typecheck, API smoke, production build, and route matrix all passed.
- The current production frontend is restored from the previous image, not the newly built local bundle. No claim is made that Pass 99 frontend source/tooling is included in that runtime image.
- A second bundle transfer was attempted through SSH, but repeated connections timed out/reset and the resumed byte offset could not be trusted. The temporary incomplete files were removed without extraction. Production remains `healthy`; root and `/play/swarm` both returned HTTP 200.
- Next publication attempt must use a stable deployment channel or a remote build from synchronized source; do not clear the serving directory before full archive integrity validation.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 98

### Scope completed

- Added authenticated TIME/Empire state fixture coverage: initial state read, versioned command update, revision increment, and stale-revision conflict rejection.
- This verifies the brief's input -> rule -> state -> save -> analytics event contract at the API boundary.

### Verification

- `python test_api.py` returned `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.
- `npm run qa:release` remains `ready` with zero route failures.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 115

### Scope completed

- Revalidated the live Contabo runtime: `osgard-world` is healthy and the backend health contract remains available.
- Added an explicit safe frontend replacement procedure to `DEPLOYMENT.md`: validate the complete archive before extraction, stage into a new directory, switch only after checksum and route checks, and retain a rollback directory.
- Documented the publication boundary so a passing local release gate is not misreported as proof that a new frontend bundle is live.

### Verification

- `npm run qa:release` returned `status: ready` (typecheck, API smoke, production build, archive preflight, and 30-route desktop/mobile matrix).
- Production container status: `osgard-world` healthy.
- Backend health: `{"status":"ok","service":"osgard-game-api","contractVersion":1}`.

### Publication boundary

- No frontend replacement was attempted in this pass. The current production UI remains the previously validated image because the large archive transfer path is not yet a stable, verified deployment channel.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 116

### Scope completed

- Built a fresh frontend archive from the release-gated `dist` output and recorded its SHA-256 before transfer.
- Attempted a non-destructive chunked upload into `/tmp/osgard-pass115` on Contabo; the SSH channel closed after the first two chunks and the transfer was stopped.
- Confirmed the active container was never replaced and no serving directory was cleared.

### Verification

- Local archive: 18,911,965 bytes; SHA-256 `594988B751736D590C8D63E53BCE72F7474717D7C9DEA335AA438610B6D06B7F`.
- Remote staging contained only the first two 524,288-byte chunks; incomplete data was not extracted.
- The previous `qa:release` result remains `ready`; production health was not changed by this attempt.

### Publication boundary

- Frontend publication remains pending because the SSH transport repeatedly terminates during archive transfer. The partial staging upload is not a release artifact and must not be activated.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 117

### Scope completed

- Tested a single-session SSH stream as a second transfer path for the release archive after repeated `scp` resets.
- The remote host reset the stream after receiving only 2,048 bytes; the partial remote file was removed immediately.

### Verification

- Production container remained healthy and serving the prior validated image.
- No archive was extracted and no active document root was changed.

### Publication boundary

- The transport limitation is now reproduced across both `scp` and a direct SSH stream. A stable deployment channel or remote build is required before activating the new frontend bundle.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 118

### Scope completed

- Inspected the Contabo host for a safe remote-build fallback.
- Confirmed `/opt/osgard-world` exists, but it is an older source checkout without `node_modules`; the host also lacks the `docker compose` subcommand needed by the documented build flow.

### Verification

- The running image remains `osgard-worldnext-osgard-world:latest` and the serving container remains healthy.
- No remote build or serving-directory mutation was attempted because the available checkout cannot prove it contains the current local release.

### Publication boundary

- A remote build is not currently a valid substitute for synchronized source publication. The next release attempt requires either a stable artifact transport or an authenticated source synchronization step followed by remote dependency installation and build verification.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 119

### Scope completed

- Replaced the production-compatible static `/entertainment/index.html`, which previously exposed only one game and contained mojibake text.
- Added five distinct interactive game cards with game-specific accents and links: TIME, SWARM, NULL//SHIFT, INHERIT, and REMIX.
- Published only this 5,624-byte route artifact through verified chunk transfer; the main frontend bundle and other serving files were left untouched.

### Verification and publication

- Local and remote SHA-256 match: `8e9c03ea9231df6bef4c805d6c90ce3cd00b88f41a27874f3bd2bff784e00763`.
- `https://osgard.world/entertainment` returns HTTP 200, contains five `/games/` paths, and contains the corrected Russian copy.
- All five linked game routes return HTTP 200.
- Existing `npm run qa:release` remains `ready`; the static route was published separately after its exact checksum validation.

### Remaining boundary

- The large Vite frontend bundle is still not replaced because its SSH transfer path remains unstable. The entertainment catalogue itself is now live and verified.

## 2026-10-04 / Pass 120

### Scope completed

- Strengthened `scripts/production-route-matrix.mjs` so `/entertainment` is only green when it contains exactly five game links, five cards, and no known mojibake marker.

### Verification

- `npm run qa:production-routes` returned `status: ready`, `routes: 30`, `failed: 0`.
- The production report explicitly recorded `/entertainment` as `gameLinks: 5`, `cards: 5`, `ok: true` for desktop and mobile.
- `npm run check` passed.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 121

### Scope completed

- Added backend health verification to the guarded frontend deployment activation path.
- The deploy host must now answer `{"status":"ok","service":"osgard-game-api","contractVersion":1}` before a staged frontend release can be activated.

### Verification

- Release-readiness workflow `37379261869` completed successfully.
- Production route-matrix workflow `37379261865` completed successfully.
- The current production container and public routes remain healthy; no rollback was required.

### Publication boundary

- This pass verifies the deployment guard and public health contract. Supabase production credentials, moderation secrets, physical device labs, warehouse-scale analytics, and staffing remain external requirements documented in `BRIEF_COVERAGE_AUDIT.md`.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 122

### Scope completed

- Added the authenticated result/share route `/r/1842` to the production route matrix.
- Updated the living brief audit to distinguish the deployed result/share surface from the remaining external production requirements.

### Verification

- The route matrix now covers 32 desktop/mobile route checks, including `/r/1842`.
- The result page submits its player result through the CORE API adapter and provides clipboard/fallback sharing plus links back to the game catalogue.

### Publication boundary

- This pass proves route availability and frontend behavior; it does not fabricate production identity tokens or leaderboard data.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 123

### Scope completed

- Added backend `GET /health/ready` with redacted readiness flags for Supabase auth wiring and operator-secret provisioning.
- Extended the guarded frontend deploy workflow to require `authConfigured: true` before activation or retain the previous document root; this guard will take effect with the backend source update.
- Added smoke-test coverage for the degraded local fixture state and documented that operator readiness is intentionally separate.

### Verification

- `python osgard-game-api/test_api.py` returned `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.
- No secret values are returned by the readiness endpoint or committed to source control. The backend source and fixture test are ready locally; production activation is pending stable SSH transport.

### Publication boundary

- Production `MODERATION_ADMIN_TOKEN` is still an external operator action; the readiness contract reports it as a boolean and does not invent or provision it. The current production service was not replaced after the transport interruption.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 124

### Scope completed

- Retried backend readiness publication with a compressed archive and a single-command transfer after the SFTP channel stalled.
- The remote channel closed before checksum completion; no backend file was activated.
- Removed all partial remote staging files and retained the previous production `app.py` unchanged.

### Verification

- Remote `/opt/osgard-game-api/app.py` SHA-256 remains `dc2e1dfb9eead55eaf01d82f6d2fd1437a107085572d904eccee644f1d60ea73`.
- `osgard-game-api.service` remains `active`.
- The local readiness implementation and smoke test remain green; production readiness endpoint publication is pending a stable artifact transport.

### Publication boundary

- No rollback or destructive operation was required. The backend readiness change is not claimed as live until its remote checksum can be verified.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 125

### Scope completed

- Removed visible mojibake from the portal FAQ copy and the English private-table quotation.
- Replaced the affected Russian FAQ descriptions with readable product and data-policy text.

### Verification

- `npm run check` passed.
- `npm run build` passed and produced the frontend bundle with the corrected copy.

### Publication boundary

- The corrected source is ready for the normal frontend release workflow. Other legacy source surfaces with separate historical copy remain outside this narrow copy pass and are not claimed as corrected here.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 126

### Scope completed

- Added clean, route-specific SEO titles and descriptions for the portal, worlds, catalogue, chronicle, club, products, development, and entertainment routes.
- Wired the runtime SEO component to the clean metadata map so browser metadata no longer inherits the legacy mojibake table.

### Verification

- `npm run check` passed.
- `npm run build` passed with the updated bundle.

### Publication boundary

- The source and bundle are ready for the normal frontend deployment workflow; legacy unused metadata constants remain in source for later cleanup but are no longer used at runtime.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 127

### Scope completed

- Corrected the only detected mojibake marker in the published game HTML set: REMIX now uses an em dash in its document title.

### Verification

- `npm run preflight:frontend dist` returned `status: ready`.
- A full scan of `public/games/**/*.html` no longer finds `вЂ`, `пїЅ`, or replacement-character markers.

### Publication boundary

- Published as frontend commit `46cf3ec`; the normal GitHub release workflow remains the activation path for the new static asset.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 128

### Scope completed

- Hardened `frontend-archive-preflight` to reject replacement characters and known mojibake markers in every HTML file inside a release archive.

### Verification

- The current `dist` archive passes the new check with `status: ready`.
- The guard is part of the existing release-readiness workflow, so future static game HTML regressions fail before publication.

### Publication boundary

- This is a release gate improvement; it does not claim that unrelated legacy TypeScript copy has been fully rewritten.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 129

### Scope completed

- Ran the guarded frontend deployment workflow `37383794825`.
- The activation step correctly refused to publish because production backend does not yet expose the pending `/health/ready` contract.
- Removed that not-yet-live readiness dependency from the frontend activation guard so verified frontend releases continue to use the established `/health` rollback check.

### Verification

- The failed activation did not replace the production document root.
- Production backend remains on the existing `/health` contract and active service.

### Publication boundary

- The backend readiness endpoint remains a separate pending deployment; no claim is made that it is live.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 130

### Scope completed

- Retried guarded frontend deployment after removing the pending backend readiness dependency.
- Workflow `37383928313` completed archive build, staging, and checksum verification, then failed during activation.

### Verification

- Production container remains healthy and serves the previous verified bundle `index-Cg_No4FM.js`.
- The staged archive is present on the host and extracts successfully in a non-destructive debug directory.
- Public root and backend `/health` both return successfully; no active document root was replaced.

### Publication boundary

- The latest frontend bundle is not claimed as live. Activation failure requires a separately diagnosed container document-root step before another production attempt.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 131

### Scope completed

- Diagnosed activation failure to the full document-root copy step inside the writable `osgard-world` container.
- Reworked the guarded deploy activation to use atomic directory moves with rollback moves, avoiding a large in-container copy over the SSH command window.

### Verification

- Container root is writable, has 48 GB free, and a non-destructive extraction test passes.
- The new workflow keeps the previous document root intact until the new root is moved into place and public/backend health checks pass.

### Publication boundary

- The revised activation path is ready for one guarded deployment attempt; no new production bundle is claimed until that run succeeds.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 132

### Scope completed

- Re-ran the atomic-move deployment workflow `37384703747` to distinguish a transient SSH failure from a persistent activation problem.
- Staging and checksum verification passed again; the activation command closed with exit code 1 again.

### Verification

- Production still serves `index-Cg_No4FM.js` and the `osgard-world` container remains healthy.
- No document-root replacement or rollback mutation was observed after the failed run.
- The same activation boundary has now reproduced across copy and atomic-move implementations.

### Publication boundary

- The new frontend bundle is not claimed as live. Further attempts require a background/polled remote activation or direct operator-side inspection of the container command channel; repeating the same foreground SSH activation is not evidence of publication.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 133

### Scope completed

- Added `scripts/activate-frontend-remote.sh`, which performs activation in a background process, polls a bounded state file, and executes rollback on failed public/backend health checks.
- Updated the guarded deploy workflow to transfer and invoke this remote activation script instead of keeping the long container operation in the foreground SSH command.

### Verification

- The script uses a 45-second bounded poll and never reports success without the public root and backend `/health` checks.

### Publication boundary

- The background activation path is ready for a final guarded deployment attempt; no frontend bundle is claimed live until its workflow succeeds.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 134

### Scope completed

- Published the guarded frontend archive using the background/polled activation script.
- Workflow `37385093358` completed build, archive preflight, staging checksum, activation, and health verification successfully.

### Verification

- `https://osgard.world/` now serves bundle `index-6gUiTCiK.js`.
- `https://osgard.world/games/remix/index.html` contains the corrected title `REMIX — OSGARD Entertainment`.
- The deploy host backend health contract returns `status: ok`.

### Publication boundary

- Frontend publication is now verified live. The separate backend `/health/ready` enhancement remains pending and is not required by the current frontend deploy guard.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 135

### Scope completed

- Ran the post-deploy production route matrix against the newly activated bundle.

### Verification

- `npm run qa:production-routes` returned `status: ready`, `routes: 32`, `failed: 0`.
- Desktop and mobile checks both load `index-6gUiTCiK.js`; `/entertainment` reports five links and five cards; `/r/1842` returns HTTP 200.

### Publication boundary

- This pass confirms the live frontend route surface after activation. External Supabase identity fixtures, moderation secret provisioning, device lab, warehouse analytics, and staffing remain outside repository evidence.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 136

### Scope completed

- Updated the living brief coverage audit with the authoritative live bundle marker and post-deploy route evidence.
- Explicitly separated the verified frontend surface from backend credentials, device-lab, warehouse, and staffing requirements that still require external evidence.

### Verification

- Audit now records 32/32 production routes, five entertainment cards, and `/r/1842` as live evidence.

### Publication boundary

- Documentation only; no new runtime behavior or external secret provisioning is claimed in this pass.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 137

### Scope completed

- Re-opened the authorized Supabase operator surface for project `OSGARD SEVEN` (`zminagefqbjjisokahba`) and inspected the project overview without copying API keys, tokens, or other secret values.
- Confirmed the external dashboard currently reports `Unhealthy`; the same overview reports the primary database in `eu-west-1`, zero Postgres warnings/errors in the displayed period, no migrations, and a scheduled backup 19 hours ago.
- Re-ran public production checks after the operator inspection.

### Verification

- `https://osgard.world/` continues to serve the published `index-6gUiTCiK.js` bundle.
- `https://osgard.world/entertainment` returns HTTP 200 and the live route matrix remains the authoritative frontend evidence.
- The Supabase `Unhealthy` indicator is an external operator/platform state; no destructive SQL, billing, identity creation, or secret provisioning was performed.

### Publication boundary

- No new runtime release was needed for this pass.
- Supabase health remediation remains pending an operator-visible diagnostic or provider-side recovery; it is not claimed complete from the dashboard summary alone.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 138

### Scope completed

- Revalidated the local backend readiness implementation and its isolated contract suite.
- Local `osgard-game-api/app.py` SHA-256 is `a0f6b5b254d1df4076d048def884398ff684ebf9754751377da95578ba05c610`.
- `python osgard-game-api/test_api.py` returned `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.
- Attempted a read-only Contabo SSH preflight (remote hash, service state, `/health`, and `/health/ready`) before any transfer or restart.

### Verification

- The preflight connection was closed by `207.180.248.95` before the remote command ran; no file transfer, restart, or production mutation occurred.
- Production remains on the previously verified `/health` contract. The local `/health/ready` enhancement is still not claimed live.

### Publication boundary

- The backend readiness release is prepared and locally tested, but stable remote transport is required for checksum-verified activation.
- No fallback through Contabo reinstall or billing controls was used; those controls are destructive or unrelated to this release.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 139

### Scope completed

- Re-ran the Contabo transport check and obtained one successful read-only SSH session: the host accepted the deploy key, `osgard-game-api` was `active`, and the remote source remained on SHA-256 `dc2e1dfb...` (the pre-readiness version).
- Attempted guarded staging through `scp` and then through a bounded chunked SSH stream.
- Verified that the interrupted staging path did not activate a file; the temporary staging artifacts were removed and the service was not restarted.

### Verification

- No production mutation occurred in this pass. The backend readiness endpoint remains unclaimed in production.
- Local source and tests remain valid; the transport failure is isolated to the large/streamed write path rather than a code or checksum failure.

### Publication boundary

- The next backend publication attempt requires a stable remote transfer channel (or an operator-provided deployment channel). Contabo reinstall, password fields, billing, and other destructive controls remain out of scope.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 140

### Scope completed

- Published the prepared backend readiness release to Contabo after a checksum-verified staging transfer.
- Created a remote backup, installed the exact local `app.py`, ran remote `py_compile`, restarted `osgard-game-api`, and removed temporary staging data.

### Verification

- Remote service is `active`.
- Remote `/health` returns `{"status":"ok","service":"osgard-game-api","contractVersion":1}`.
- Remote `/health/ready` returns `{"status":"ready","service":"osgard-game-api","contractVersion":1,"authConfigured":true,"operatorConfigured":false}`.
- Remote SHA-256 matches local `a0f6b5b254d1df4076d048def884398ff684ebf9754751377da95578ba05c610`.
- `npm run qa:release` returned `status: ready`; typecheck, API smoke, production build, archive preflight, and 32-route production matrix all passed.

### Publication boundary

- Backend readiness is now live. `operatorConfigured:false` is intentional because no moderation secret was invented or provisioned.
- Frontend runtime remains the previously verified published bundle; no frontend replacement was required for this backend-only release.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 141

### Scope completed

- Inspected Supabase project `OSGARD SEVEN` Authentication -> Users through the authorized dashboard.
- The project UI reports `No users in your project`; the table has no actual user rows (the dashboard's separate estimated total is not treated as identity evidence).

### Verification

- This confirms the production backend is wired for Supabase auth (`authConfigured:true`) but has no verified production identity fixtures.
- No user, password, token, billing setting, or provider configuration was created or changed.

### Publication boundary

- Supabase identity fixtures remain an external provisioning task requiring named test accounts and an operator-approved credential handoff.
- The repository and production service remain unchanged in this pass; the observation is documented to prevent treating the estimated dashboard count as real users.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 142

### Scope completed

- Ran the post-backend-release production verification sweep.

### Verification

- Contabo `osgard-game-api` is `active`; `/health/ready` returns `status: ready`, `authConfigured: true`, and `operatorConfigured: false`.
- `npm run qa:production-routes` returned `status: ready`, `routes: 32`, `failed: 0`; `/entertainment` reports five game links and five cards.
- Desktop and mobile routes continue to load the published `index-6gUiTCiK.js` bundle.

### Publication boundary

- This pass confirms runtime stability after the backend release. Supabase production users, moderation operator secret, physical device lab, warehouse-scale analytics, and staffing remain explicit external requirements.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 143

### Scope completed

- Provisioned the two named non-privileged Supabase identity fixtures in project `OSGARD SEVEN` through Authentication -> Users using the dashboard invitation flow.
- Added `osman.osmanov0099@gmail.com` and `osman.osmanov6880@gmail.com`; both rows are visible with the email provider and distinct UIDs.

### Verification

- Supabase project ref: `zminagefqbjjisokahba`.
- Dashboard verification shows both requested email rows in the Users table.
- No passwords, access tokens, admin roles, billing settings, or moderation secrets were created or recorded.

### Publication boundary

- Identity fixture creation is complete. Bearer-token API tests still require short-lived tokens obtained locally through the documented fixture runbook; tokens must not be stored in source, logs, screenshots, or chat.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 144

### Scope completed

- Re-ran the complete `qa:release` gate after the identity fixture publication.
- Corrected the Supabase identity fixture runbook so it records the two provisioned production users while keeping token handling local-only.

### Verification

- Typecheck passed.
- API smoke passed with `OSGARD_GAME_API_SMOKE_OK`.
- Production build and frontend archive preflight passed.
- Production route matrix passed with zero failed routes; the live matrix continues to report the previously published bundle.

### Publication boundary

- Documentation now distinguishes completed identity creation from the still-local bearer-token verification step. No credentials or secrets were added to the repository.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 145

### Scope completed

- Reconciled the living 255-section coverage audit after production identity provisioning.
- Added an explicit superseding note so the audit no longer relies on the pre-provisioning state as current evidence.

### Verification

- Audit still maps all 255 numbered brief sections to implementation evidence, documented contracts, or explicit external requirements.
- `git diff --check` passes and no runtime source was changed in this documentation-only pass.

### Publication boundary

- This pass changes only evidence wording; it does not claim bearer-token API verification, moderation-secret provisioning, physical-device execution, or staffing that has not been performed.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 146

### Scope completed

- Added `scripts/brief-coverage-audit.mjs` and the `npm run qa:brief` command.
- The validator checks the authoritative brief's SHA-256, line/byte counts, and numbered section sequence from 1 through 255.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 147

### Scope completed

- Corrected the brief audit after inspecting the source context around section 242.
- The section is present in a dated conversation line (`...: # 242.`), followed by sections 243-255; a separate `# 0` preamble also exists.

### Verification

- `npm run qa:brief` recognizes all 255 sections and preserves the authoritative SHA-256, line count, and byte count.
- The discrepancy is documented as a source correction; no runtime feature is claimed from a heading count alone.

### Publication boundary

- This pass expands the audit scope to the actual source file. It does not invent section 242 or mark roadmap/staffing requirements implemented without direct evidence.

### Verification

- The command is deterministic and exits non-zero when a section is missing, duplicated, or outside the expected range.
- `git diff --check` passes; no production runtime or secret handling changed.

### Publication boundary

- This is an audit/reproducibility improvement. It does not upgrade documented or external requirements into implemented runtime evidence.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 148

### Scope completed

- Ran the full release gate after the brief validator update.
- Re-ran the production route matrix after one transient network failure on mobile `/games/time`.

### Verification

- Typecheck, API smoke, production build, and frontend archive preflight passed.
- The first matrix run reported one `fetch failed` transport error; an immediate repeat returned `routes: 32`, `failed: 0`, `status: ready`.
- All desktop and mobile routes, five entertainment cards, and referenced assets passed on the successful repeat.

### Publication boundary

- No production files were changed in this pass. The transient failure was not treated as a code regression because the bounded repeat passed and the route response was HTTP 200.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 149

### Scope completed

- Integrated the source brief validator into `scripts/release-readiness.mjs`.
- The release gate now runs `brief-source-audit` when the authoritative external file is present and records a non-blocking `skipped` result in repository-only CI when it is unavailable.

### Verification

- The gate preserves the existing typecheck, API, build, archive, and route checks.
- `brief-source-audit` uses the same SHA-256 and 1-255 numbering validation as `npm run qa:brief`.

### Publication boundary

- This is release-gate and documentation infrastructure; it does not claim external source availability in CI environments where the brief file is not mounted.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 150

### Scope completed

- Fixed Windows path handling for the integrated brief audit by invoking the Node validator without shell argument splitting.

### Verification

- `npm run qa:release` returned `status: ready`.
- All checks passed, including `brief-source-audit` with 255 sections, 24,226 lines, 388,964 bytes, and the authoritative SHA-256.

### Publication boundary

- The release gate now has reproducible source-integrity evidence alongside runtime checks; no production deployment was triggered by this documentation/tooling change.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 151

### Scope completed

- Extended the TIME state contract with a persisted `lastConsequence` explanation for each tax decision.
- Added regression coverage proving that a higher-tax decision records both the political consequence and the energy cost.

### Verification

- The state transition remains deterministic and preserves the existing treasury, approval, energy, and collapse rules.
- The new fixture fails if a decision changes numbers without recording its system consequence.

### Publication boundary

- This pass strengthens the simulation state contract; it does not claim a full production economy or staffing system beyond the implemented vertical slice.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 152

### Scope completed

- Expanded TIME regression coverage to higher-tax, lower-tax, and steady-tax decisions.
- Asserted that each branch records a distinct consequence while energy continues to decrement deterministically.

### Verification

- TypeScript build remains the compile gate for the state fixture; the assertions cover all consequence branches.

### Publication boundary

- This pass improves vertical-slice confidence only; it does not claim unimplemented production economy systems.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 153

### Scope completed

- Added `scripts/core-state-smoke.mjs` and `npm run qa:core` to execute the real TIME state module under Node's type-stripping runtime.
- Added the smoke check to the release gate alongside typecheck and API smoke.

### Verification

- `qa:core` exercises higher-tax, lower-tax, and steady-tax transitions and returns `OSGARD_CORE_STATE_SMOKE_OK`.
- The runner avoids changing browser-facing extensionless imports solely to satisfy a Node test harness.

### Publication boundary

- This adds executable vertical-slice evidence; it does not claim full economy production infrastructure.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 154

### Scope completed

- Ran the manual GitHub Actions `OSGARD frontend deploy` workflow for the current `master` revision after the local resumable SSH transfer was reset.
- The workflow completed successfully with checksum-verified archive staging and activation commands.

### Verification

- GitHub Actions run `37396405893` completed with `success`.
- Production route matrix after the run returned `32` routes and `failed: 0`; `/entertainment` still reports five cards.
- The public HTML continues to reference the existing `index-6gUiTCiK.js` bundle, so this pass records route health and workflow success but does not overclaim a bundle hash replacement without stronger remote artifact evidence.

### Publication boundary

- The frontend deploy workflow is operational. Bundle replacement remains subject to direct remote checksum evidence when the public HTML changes; no rollback or destructive action was performed.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 155

### Scope completed

- Audited the manual frontend deploy workflow after the public bundle remained unchanged.
- Corrected the activation archive path: staging uploads `/tmp/osgard-gh-release/osgard-world-release.tgz`, and activation now consumes that exact checksum-verified file instead of a different root-level path.

### Verification

- The workflow source now has one consistent archive path from upload through activation.
- No production activation was performed from the local shell; the corrected workflow requires a new GitHub Actions run for runtime proof.

### Publication boundary

- This pass fixes a deployment correctness defect. The next workflow run must confirm the new bundle hash in public HTML before frontend replacement is claimed live.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 156

### Scope completed

- Diagnosed the failed corrected deploy run: the archive existed on the host staging path, but activation extracts inside the `osgard-world` container.
- Updated the workflow to `docker cp` the checksum-verified archive into the container before running activation.

### Verification

- GitHub run `37420429666` reached staging checksum verification and failed only at container archive lookup, confirming the host/container path boundary.
- The next deploy run will use `/tmp/osgard-gh-release.tgz` inside the container, matching `activate-frontend-remote.sh`.

### Publication boundary

- No production content was activated by the failed run; rollback was not needed. A new workflow run is required for live bundle evidence.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 157

### Scope completed

- Published the corrected frontend archive through GitHub Actions after copying it into the serving container before activation.

### Verification

- GitHub Actions run `37420564965` completed successfully, including archive checksum verification and container activation.
- Public HTML now references `index-CFZKU4Xw.js`, replacing the previously observed `index-6gUiTCiK.js`.
- Production route matrix passed with `32` routes and `failed: 0`; desktop/mobile assets and all five entertainment cards passed.

### Publication boundary

- The current frontend bundle is live and route-verified. Backend operator secrets, physical device execution, warehouse operations, and staffing remain separate external requirements.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 158

### Scope completed

- Reconciled the living brief audit with the verified post-activation production bundle.
- Updated the current live bundle marker from `index-6gUiTCiK.js` to `index-CFZKU4Xw.js`.

### Verification

- Public HTML inspection with a cache-busting query references `index-CFZKU4Xw.js`.
- The successful route matrix confirms the same bundle on desktop and mobile across 32 routes.

### Publication boundary

- Historical pass entries retain their original bundle evidence; only the current audit conclusion and new pass use the latest live marker.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 159

### Scope completed

- Re-ran the authoritative brief audit and inspected the public production HTML after frontend activation.

### Verification

- `npm run qa:brief` returned `status: ready` with all 255 sections and the fixed source hash.
- Public root and the current route shell reference `index-CFZKU4Xw.js`.
- The public `/health` paths are handled by the frontend shell; backend readiness remains separately verified through the Contabo service contract and is not inferred from the SPA fallback.

### Publication boundary

- This pass separates public frontend evidence from backend health evidence; no backend claim is upgraded based on the HTML fallback.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 160

### Scope completed

- Ran the complete release gate after live frontend activation and audit reconciliation.

### Verification

- `qa:release` returned `status: ready`.
- Typecheck, core state smoke, API smoke, production build, archive preflight, production route matrix, and brief source audit all passed.
- The route matrix verified the live `index-CFZKU4Xw.js` bundle on desktop and mobile.

### Publication boundary

- This is a final verification pass for the current release state; external operator, device-lab, warehouse, and staffing requirements remain explicitly outside repository evidence.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 161

### Scope completed

- Hardened the client CORE pending-event queue against a flush race: events recorded while an earlier network flush is in flight are re-read and preserved instead of being overwritten.
- Added a focused queue reconciliation smoke check and included it in the release gate.

### Verification

- `npm run qa:queue` returns `OSGARD_EVENT_QUEUE_SMOKE_OK`.
- `npm run check` passes.
- The full release gate below is required before publication.

### Publication boundary

- This pass improves client-side event durability only; it does not change authentication, moderation, or external production-operation boundaries.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 162

### Scope completed

- Published commit `921e127` through the frontend deployment workflow.

### Verification

- GitHub Actions deploy run `37424638011` completed successfully, including checksum-verified staging and activation.
- The live production route matrix reports `32` routes with `failed: 0`.
- `/entertainment` reports five game links and five cards on desktop; the same live bundle `index-Cr9o8DoX.js` is served on desktop and mobile routes.

### Publication boundary

- The concurrent CORE queue fix is live in the current frontend bundle. Backend operator, device-lab, warehouse, and staffing requirements remain external evidence boundaries.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 163

### Scope completed

- Reconciled the living brief audit with the post-deploy production asset marker.

### Verification

- `npm run qa:release` returned `status: ready` after the deploy.
- The production route matrix confirmed `32` routes with `failed: 0` and live bundle `index-Cr9o8DoX.js` on desktop and mobile.
- `/entertainment` still reports five game links and five cards.

### Publication boundary

- This pass corrects evidence documentation only; it does not upgrade any external operator, device-lab, warehouse, or staffing requirement to completed.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 164

### Scope completed

- Added automatic CORE pending-event retries when the browser regains connectivity or the user returns to the OSGARD tab.

### Verification

- `npm run check` passes.
- `npm run qa:queue` returns `OSGARD_EVENT_QUEUE_SMOKE_OK`.
- The retry listeners are browser-guarded and do not execute during server/build evaluation.

### Publication boundary

- This improves authenticated event delivery resilience; it does not alter token, moderation, or external production-operation boundaries.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 165

### Scope completed

- Published the reconnect/visibility retry improvement through the production frontend workflow.

### Verification

- GitHub Actions deploy run `37425507130` completed successfully.
- The live route matrix reports `32` routes and `failed: 0`.
- `/entertainment` reports five game links and five cards; the live bundle is `index-Dws_OJZ2.js` on desktop and mobile.

### Publication boundary

- CORE retry behavior is live. External operator, device-lab, warehouse, and staffing requirements remain explicitly unverified.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 166

### Scope completed

- Reconciled the TIME game package with its shipped runtime: the networking contract now records the authenticated revisioned server state API and stale-command rejection instead of marking networking as pending.

### Verification

- The API smoke gate exercises authenticated empire state reads, revision increments, and stale revision rejection.
- `npm run qa:release` remains `ready` after the documentation correction.

### Publication boundary

- This pass updates a design-package status line to match existing evidence; it does not claim the external warehouse, device lab, staffing, or operator-secret requirements.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 167

### Scope completed

- Corrected the current brief audit to describe the verified 32-route production matrix rather than the earlier 30-route scope.

### Verification

- The latest production verifier reports `32` routes with `failed: 0`.
- The release gate and brief source audit remain green; historical pass entries retain their original scope.

### Publication boundary

- This is an evidence-documentation correction only. No external production requirement is reclassified.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 168

### Scope completed

- Added `qa:production-api`, a fail-closed authenticated production API probe that checks `/health/ready` and a bearer-token player profile request when CI secrets are provisioned.
- Wired the probe into the release workflow without adding, logging, or inventing credentials.

### Verification

- With production credentials absent, the probe returns an explicit `skipped` result and exits successfully.
- When both environment variables are present, non-200 readiness/profile responses fail the release gate; output contains only status metadata.

### Publication boundary

- The probe creates the missing verification path but does not claim bearer-token production evidence until an operator provisions the GitHub secrets.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 169

### Scope completed

- Extended the Supabase identity-fixture runbook with the guarded production probe invocation and its secret-handling boundary.

### Verification

- The documented command uses only environment variables and short-lived bearer tokens.
- `qa:production-api` remains explicitly `skipped` when either variable is absent and never prints credential values.

### Publication boundary

- This makes the outstanding operator handoff executable and auditable; it does not claim that a production bearer token has been issued or used.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 170

### Scope completed

- Added a local `qa:production-api-smoke` fixture that exercises the production probe's readiness and bearer profile branches against an ephemeral HTTP server.
- Added the fixture to the release gate so probe regressions fail before publication.

### Verification

- `npm run qa:production-api-smoke` returns `OSGARD_PRODUCTION_API_PROBE_SMOKE_OK`.
- `npm run check` passes; the fixture never contacts production and uses only an in-process token.

### Publication boundary

- This validates the probe implementation, not production bearer-token evidence. Production verification remains skipped until approved secrets are provisioned.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 171

### Scope completed

- Extended the production API probe smoke fixture with an invalid-token path.

### Verification

- Valid fixture credentials produce a ready report.
- Invalid credentials fail closed, and the rejected token is absent from captured stdout/stderr.
- `npm run qa:production-api-smoke` remains green.

### Publication boundary

- This is local security-contract evidence only; no production credential was issued or tested.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 172

### Scope completed

- Ran the production dependency audit for the published frontend package.

### Verification

- `npm audit --omit=dev --json` reports zero info, low, moderate, high, or critical production vulnerabilities across 13 production dependencies.

### Publication boundary

- This is dependency evidence only; it does not change the external operator, bearer-token, device-lab, warehouse, or staffing boundaries.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 173

### Scope completed

- Strengthened the production route matrix to fetch every `/entertainment` game link, not only count cards and href attributes.

### Verification

- The live matrix confirms `32` routes with `failed: 0`.
- Both desktop and mobile catalog checks validate five cards and five playable links: TIME, SWARM, NULL//SHIFT, INHERIT, and REMIX.

### Publication boundary

- This improves automated portal/catalog verification; it does not alter game content or external operational requirements.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 174

### Scope completed

- Removed the final hardcoded card count from the production route report; catalog evidence now records and validates the measured card count.

### Verification

- Production matrix reports `32` routes with `failed: 0`.
- Desktop and mobile `/entertainment` checks report measured `gameLinks: 5` and `cards: 5`, with every link returning HTTP 200.

### Publication boundary

- This strengthens verifier accuracy only; game content and external operational requirements are unchanged.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 175

### Scope completed

- Updated the lockfile to resolve the transitive `source-map-js` high-severity advisory affecting the development toolchain.

### Verification

- `npm audit --json` now reports zero vulnerabilities across production and development dependencies.
- The production-only audit remains clean as well; release gate verification follows this lockfile update.

### Publication boundary

- This changes dependency resolution only and does not alter application behavior or external operational requirements.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 176

### Scope completed

- Added `npm audit --audit-level=high` to the release-readiness gate.

### Verification

- The gate now fails publication when high or critical dependency advisories are present, while the current lockfile remains clean.

### Publication boundary

- This is a CI security invariant; it does not alter runtime behavior or external production requirements.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 178

### Scope completed

- Added the two optional production API probe secret names and their handling rules to the production release handoff.

### Verification

- The handoff matches `.github/workflows/release-readiness.yml` and `scripts/production-api-probe.mjs`.
- No secret values were added; the release gate remains green with the probe explicitly skipped when unprovisioned.

### Publication boundary

- This documents an operator action and does not claim that bearer credentials or moderation secrets are provisioned.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 179

### Scope completed

- Added `qa:live-bundle`, which compares the bundle served by production HTML with the current live bundle marker in `BRIEF_COVERAGE_AUDIT.md`.
- Included the marker check in the release-readiness gate.

### Verification

- `npm run qa:live-bundle` reports `index-Dws_OJZ2.js` for both production and the audit.
- A missing or mismatched marker now fails the release gate instead of silently leaving stale publication evidence.

### Publication boundary

- This strengthens publication evidence and does not alter application runtime or external operational requirements.

## 2026-10-06 / Pass 177

### Scope completed

- Added bounded three-attempt retry/backoff to each `/entertainment` game-link probe, with attempt counts retained in the route evidence.

### Verification

- The production matrix still requires five measured links and HTTP 200 for every game; retries only tolerate transient transport failures.
- Full local release gate remains the required publication check.

### Publication boundary

- This changes verifier resilience only; it does not weaken catalog correctness or alter external production requirements.


## 2026-10-15 / Pass 180

### Scope completed

- Added MERAKKI GLOBAL as a second featured case in OSGARD Development, preserving the existing TEDES card and its latest styling.
- Added a bilingual page at `/development/merakki/` with a direct link to the public storefront demo and an explicit demo-only / checkout-disabled boundary.
- Added the route to sitemap and production route matrix; expanded the ecosystem smoke test to validate the card, metadata, direct demo link and safety boundary.
- Added responsive editorial styling specific to MERAKKI.

### Verification and deployment

- Changed `src/**` paths trigger the current master-branch frontend validation and SSH deployment workflow.
- The Actions conclusions and live route response must be inspected after push. A source commit by itself does not prove publication.

### Delivery boundary

- The linked storefront is a demo: real order submission, checkout and payments remain disabled.
- Dashboard and partial-refund logic are represented as source scope, not as an active public admin interface.
- Remaining release gates are deployment workflow success and public route verification.


## 2026-10-15 / Pass 181

### Scope completed

- Added a dedicated project-enquiry section to the MERAKKI case, separate from the demo action.
- Added bilingual WhatsApp and email CTA links. Their prefilled message / subject / body adapt to the selected RU or EN locale.
- Added campaign parameters to the header, hero and final demo links so visits from the OSGARD Development case can be attributed downstream.
- Added responsive styling and updated repository integrity checks plus the public route matrix to require attribution markers and direct contact options.

### Verification and delivery boundary

- Modified `src/**` assets trigger the existing master-branch frontend validation and SSH publication workflow.
- The case remains a showcase page and the linked restaurant storefront remains a demo. Live checkout/payment capability is not enabled by this change.
- Release gate: check validation and deployment workflow conclusions and public desktop/mobile route responses.


## 2026-10-15 / Pass 182

### Scope completed

- Hardened the MERAKKI enquiry section for narrow screens by allowing content/actions to shrink and wrapping long CTA labels safely.
- Triggered the dedicated deployment-recovery concurrency lane because the standard deployment attempt remained stalled before the build stage. Existing concurrent OSGARD changes were preserved.

### Verification

- TypeScript and ecosystem integrity checks passed after the localized-contact assertion was aligned with the JSON-serialized RU/EN dictionaries.
- Final release gate is the recovery run's production build, server activation, and desktop/mobile route matrix.


## 2026-10-15 / Pass 183

### Scope completed

- Hardened the existing deploy recovery lane: a commit marked `[supersede]` now cancels a stale recovery run and bypasses the Godot cache step.
- The official Godot 4.7.2/Web export-template download path remains active for recovery commits; standard deployments keep using the cache.
- Extended `qa:deploy-workflow` to guard both recovery behaviours.

### Reason and verification boundary

- The standard deployment and one recovery attempt remained on the Godot cache step without advancing, so the recovery workflow avoids that step instead of declaring a failed build successful.
- The next superseding deployment must still pass the normal Godot import/runtime smoke, production build, checksum activation and live public route matrix.


## 2026-10-15 / Pass 184

### Scope completed

- Made every frontend deployment use run-scoped remote staging, archive and activation-script paths based on `GITHUB_RUN_ID`.
- Added deploy-workflow smoke assertions so concurrent release attempts cannot overwrite a shared checksum/archive directory.
- Kept the dedicated supersede recovery behaviour: the incoming recovery run cancels an older recovery attempt and skips the cache before using the official Godot/Web-template download fallback.

### Verification

- Production route checks previously confirmed the MERAKKI page returns HTTP 200 in both desktop and mobile modes.
- Two overlapping deployment runs were stopped at checksum verification before activation; the new path isolation directly addresses that race.
- The newest recovery run must still pass static workflow smoke, production build, checksum, activation and route matrix.
