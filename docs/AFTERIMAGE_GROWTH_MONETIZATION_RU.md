# AFTERIMAGE//RUN — growth & monetization plan

## Product pitch
A compact sci-fi precision runner in OSGARD PLAY: the same UTC daily seed for everyone, a personal best/ghost, a challenge URL carrying the seed and target score, a share-result image, and a cosmetic SIGNAL SHARD that can be claimed once per UTC day only after the player explicitly confirms a share action. Merely copying the link or opening a social composer does not grant the shard. The game explicitly tells the player that the actual public post is not verified.

## Viral loop to measure
1. A player starts from the OSGARD games catalog or Entertainment.
2. The daily seed and score make a compact challenge ("beat this route / beat this score").
3. Native share or Telegram, VK, X, WhatsApp and copy-link buttons create a route-specific challenge URL.
4. The recipient lands on the same date/seed, plays their run and can share their result.
5. A non-transferable, cosmetic shard provides a small in-game acknowledgement. It does not alter speed, score, or paid rights.

The share incentive is a locally stored cosmetic acknowledgement after the player explicitly confirms they published/shared the result, not proof that a post was published. Copying a link does not grant the reward. Client-only localStorage is easy to reset and is not anti-fraud. Before offering tradable/paid value or a referral payout, implement server-side invite attribution, idempotent referral records, account/abuse controls, and require a qualified referred player's first completed session. The local shard is cosmetic-only.

## Owned-service intermission
On closing an embedded game session, show one optional luxury cross-promotion panel containing the ten OSGARD-owned products. The player chooses a specific card then explicitly opens that destination, or dismisses the intermission. Each link carries:
- \`utm_source=osgard_games\`
- \`utm_medium=intermission\`
- \`utm_campaign=ecosystem_cross_promo\`
- \`utm_content=<service-id>\`

The panel is not a third-party advertising network, not a paid impression, and must be identified as owned-project cross-promotion. Events are sent only when the platform's existing consent flag is affirmative and a valid authenticated token is present. No personal data is added to UTM parameters.

## Monetization ladder
1. **Now — owned-service referrals and qualified development inquiries.** Track actual outbound clicks, brief form drafts and submitted/qualified leads separately. A click is not revenue; a mail draft is not a submitted lead. Follow attribution in a CRM and measure closed contracts/contribution margin.
2. **After a user cohort is observed — clearly labeled partner placements.** Sell a defined campaign, date window, context, geography, frequency cap and report. Separate advertiser creatives from owned-project cards. Do not log fake impressions/clicks.
3. **After an ad provider approves the property — optional rewarded video on selected browser games.** Prompt only at a safe break, offer a defined non-cash/non-transferable game reward and an equally functional "No thanks" path. Grant the reward only after the provider's signed/server-side completion callback is validated and deduplicated.
4. **After repeat-use evidence — premium content/one-time unlocks.** Sell additional tracks, game modes, aesthetics or a supporter pack. Store rights/receipts server-side; don't let a client flag confer paid access.
5. **Only after multiple games and recurring value exist — OSGARD PREMIUM.** Test clear alternatives such as ad-free browser catalogue, premium missions or a cross-game bundle. Prices in test pages are hypotheses, not "market prices". Avoid subscriptions until churn, content cadence, refunds and cancellation are understood.

### Platform constraints
- Cross-promoting the owner's own sites is the current model; it is not counted as revenue until a real conversion is attributed.
- For Google-served rewarded ads, the user must clearly opt in; skipped ads must not block normal use and the promised reward must be delivered. For any rewarded integration, use server-side verification and deduplicate the callback transaction. Official policy/docs: https://support.google.com/admob/answer/7313578 and https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9603226
- Do not ship a paid-ad or rewarded-ad business model inside a Steam build. Steam's rules disallow paid advertising in games, including advertising-based access and rewards for ad engagement; cross-promotion is a different supported category.

## $1,000,000 arithmetic — not a forecast
No user count, eCPM, store conversion or service-close rate has been proven for this project yet. The following equations explain the scale required; they are not expected results:

- Ads: at an *assumed* net eCPM of $2.50, $1m / $2.50 × 1,000 = 400,000,000 billable impressions before fixed costs, taxes, refunds and overhead.
- Direct product sales: at $10 net contribution per purchase, 100,000 completed purchases yield $1m contribution before fixed costs.
- Development services: at $4,000 contribution margin per closed project, 250 projects yield $1m contribution before general overhead and taxes. Leads needed depend on the observed close rate.
- A mixed model should add only measured net contributions; do not sum page views, outbound clicks and drafted emails as if they were money.

## Measurement plan
Track, respecting existing consent/auth rules:
- catalog visit -> game open -> successful engine handshake -> completed session;
- session duration, crash/load failures and day-1/day-7 return cohorts;
- share intent by method, challenge landing, challenge-start and referred-session completion;
- intermission shown, chosen service, CTA click, destination UTM, qualified lead, closed contract and contribution margin;
- later: ad request/fill/viewable completion, verified rewarded callback, purchases, refunds and entitlements.

Minimum useful release experiment:
- Recruit 20–30 external playtesters, including users who have not watched the developer play.
- Compare the same build with/without the post-run share prompt; evaluate completion, replay and share-initiation rates, not just button clicks.
- Check whether users understand the daily seed and challenge without a verbal explanation.
- Audit whether the intermission is dismissible, one click from choice to destination, mobile-readable and never rendered over a live run.
- Keep the promotion-frequency choice test separate from game-balance testing.

## Release boundaries
The first release uses local personal-best data and a locally stored cosmetic shard. It has no public leaderboard, cross-device save, ad SDK, payment processor or server-backed referral reward. The intermission is owned-service cross-promotion, not third-party ads. Activate server-backed monetization only after accounts, provider approval, webhook/signature validation, consent and refund handling exist.

## Quality pass — 14 October 2026

The current implementation adds these reliability and measurement safeguards:

- The obstacle/spawn random stream is separated from decorative stars, particles and camera shake so visual effects do not change the seeded gameplay sequence.
- Date and target-score parameters are validated; a challenge is beaten only when the new score is strictly higher than the target.
- The single animation-frame loop can be cancelled on pause, restart, hidden-tab transition and page exit; hidden tabs pause the run and reduced-motion settings suppress idle animation.
- Challenge URLs use the canonical invite landing and keep a validated UTC day, target score, referral code and UTM campaign. The invite landing forwards a valid AFTERIMAGE challenge into the game instead of dropping the target.
- The host session lifecycle records allowlisted challenge metadata on start and completion: target, score, win/loss, shard count, daily seed, referral code and dash count. Embedded share events avoid duplicate direct analytics from the game frame.
- Open Graph/Twitter summary-card metadata is present for the result URL. A result-card image uses a short route label to avoid overflowing with long referral URLs.

### Funnel to report (do not conflate these events)

1. Catalogue/Entertainment card seen → game launch → engine ready → completed run.
2. Challenge created → invite landing opened → challenge accepted and game started → target beaten (or not beaten).
3. Share UI opened by channel → player-confirmed share claim → referred player completed a session.
4. OSGARD SELECT shown → chosen service → click-through with UTM → qualified inquiry → closed contract and contribution margin.

The game is still client-side for personal-best/ghost and the cosmetic shard. Those values can be cleared or manipulated and must not be used for cash rewards, paid rights, a public leaderboard or verified referral payments. Challenge telemetry should be considered directional until the repository CI and a real browser cohort confirm it end-to-end.
