# NULL//SHIFT — Godot port

This is the engine-backed 3D version of NULL//SHIFT. The catalog opens `/games/null-shift-godot/` as its primary entry. The earlier Canvas game remains available at `/games/null-shift/` as a separate compatibility fallback.

## Engine and rendering

- Godot 4.7.2 stable, GDScript, Compatibility renderer. The browser build is the preferred 3D entry; the earlier Canvas version remains available as fallback.
- Browser export uses the single-threaded Web template to avoid SharedArrayBuffer and cross-origin-isolation requirements.
- Procedural 3D arena with corner signal pylons, inlaid energy rails and three timed phase conduits. Amber warning bands charge before the red active phase. A preallocated 3D surge head, orbit ring and trailing wake visibly travel down the warning lane and continue through discharge; three HUD chips mirror each conduit’s state. The operator takes real damage while standing in an active lane and can dodge or use NULL Shift to avoid it. A live health bar changes from cyan to amber to red as vitality drops. Distinct Stalker/Heavy/Ranger/Warden behavior has dodgeable telegraphed attacks and line-of-sight checks, layered operator armor and guard helmets, physics collisions, terminal, quantum core, extraction pad, metallic/emissive materials, fog, dynamic lighting, shadows, configurable glow, reticle, camera impact response, particles, and synthesized sound.
- No third-party runtime assets, remote fonts or external image dependencies.

## First-run briefing

The first launch opens a pausing Russian-language field briefing with the three mission steps and separate desktop/touch controls. Enter, Space, Escape or the primary button dismisses it. Completion is saved locally; H reopens the briefing later. A scroll container adapts it to narrow screens.

## Raid loop

1. Reach the terminal and interact with E or the mobile action button.
2. Enter the directional cipher: up, left, down, right.
3. Fight or evade guards and destroy the EMP relay, energy cell, or phase anchor for different tactical effects.
4. Secure the quantum core and reach extraction.
5. Bank career credits, install persistent local upgrades, and replay one of three contracts.

## Controls

- WASD or arrow keys: move.
- Mouse: aim; hold left mouse button: fire.
- E: interact; Q: pulse; Space: tactical dash (short burst with one-hit evade window and 1.65 s cooldown); Shift: phase shift.
- F2 cycles three persisted graphics profiles: Cinematic (glow + shadows), Balanced (shadows + practical fill lights), and Performance (reduced dynamic lighting). Cinematic mode still adapts down under sustained frame-time pressure and restores effects after stable pacing.
- F3 toggles live diagnostics; M toggles and persists sound; Esc pauses; C rotates contracts; U opens loadout; 1/2/3 buy upgrades.
- Touch screens include dedicated graphics-profile and FPS/diagnostics buttons alongside movement, fire, action, pulse, phase-shift, dash and pause controls; the dash button shows cooldown and aiming is assisted. On a 390 px viewport, the four movement buttons are 44×44 CSS px and the six combat buttons are 75×44 CSS px.
- Pause freezes raid time, movement, hazards and ability cooldowns. The native pause menu focuses Continue; Enter resumes and Tab reaches Restart. Touch Pause is idempotent so a touch and its emulated mouse press cannot immediately resume the game. Losing window focus clears held touch/fire input and pauses an active raid.

## Live diagnostics

The game reads the current engine frame rate, rolling 95th percentile of uncapped frame intervals, actual frame interval, draw calls, hostiles and remaining devices. The reticle follows desktop aim and hides during touch-assisted aiming; damage and phase changes trigger brief camera and screen feedback. Values are calculated in the running game, not demonstration placeholders. Career and upgrades are saved locally by the engine.

## Browser launch shell

The exported page uses a first-party responsive boot screen with a real byte-progress callback from Godot, explicit WebGL 2 capability detection, a fullscreen control, reduced-motion support, and a fallback link to the lightweight Canvas edition. No remote fonts, image CDN, analytics or external script are used. The progress bar is tied to the export loader; it does not simulate percentage progress.

The shell owns the canvas rectangle and updates its HiDPI backing dimensions with `ResizeObserver`. Godot uses the canvas CSS dimensions as its logical layout size, including on resize, so the 1600×900 desktop base cannot shrink phone controls into a letterboxed strip. The header has its own space above the scene. Pause, cipher, career and result panels fit the current width. Four small first-party SVG assets supply direction icons because the exported default font does not include the arrow glyphs.

## Browser export

The common build helper verifies the pinned official Godot 4.7.2 engine and matching web templates, imports the project, runs a headless state-transition test for combat, hacking, extraction, telemetry and upgrades, exports the Web build, and records source/export hashes. The compiled output is generated locally or by CI and is not committed to source control. Script `.gd.uid` and SVG `.import` files are source metadata; keep them with their corresponding files while leaving the `.godot` cache untracked.

From the repository root:

```sh
npm run build:games
npm run qa:games-local
```

`build:games` creates the actual Godot export and then builds the frontend. `qa:games-local` runs the complete Chromium matrix against a disposable local Core/REMIX service; its authentication and API responses are real. A focused NULL SHIFT run against an existing build can use:

```sh
node scripts/games-browser-acceptance.mjs --root dist --only null-shift
```

The focused command covers the primary Godot page and the separate lightweight fallback at 1440×1000 and 390×844. Playwright Chromium must be installed (`npx playwright install chromium`); `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` can select its installation directory. JSON reports and screenshots go to `test-results/games-browser` by default, or to an explicit `--out` directory.

### Real browser acceptance

The primary scenario launches the official WASM engine, checks native rendered frames and draw calls, dismisses the briefing, moves the real `CharacterBody3D`, hits an actual guard through mouse/touch fire, activates pulse/phase/dash, freezes and resumes the raid, and restarts into a new native scene. It also measures the phone controls and modal bounds and opens/closes career modules. The weapon ray uses the same vertical offset as the visible muzzle; the earlier ray originated above the Stalker/Ranger collision capsules and could not hit them even with correct aim.

The URL flag `?test=1` enables `window.__NULL_SHIFT_GODOT_TEST__.state()`. This bridge returns a fresh, recursively frozen observation of the running native scene. It exposes no setters, gameplay commands, save editing, teleportation or victory injection. All actions in `scripts/null-shift-godot-browser.mjs` use real keyboard, mouse or touch input. Ordinary launch URLs do not publish the bridge. The smoke scenario verifies these controls and transitions; it does not claim a full mission victory, physical-phone coverage or production-service readiness.


## Release 0.6 — animated operator and bounded effect pools

- The operator rig smoothly turns toward the aim direction, uses opposing procedural leg swings driven by movement speed, and adds small lean and recoil. Each actual weapon shot triggers a short emissive muzzle flash and a local light pulse.
- Tracer/attack beams and pulse rings use bounded reusable MeshInstance3D pools. Beam surfaces are refreshed on an existing ImmediateMesh; rings animate scale and transparency from frame delta, then return hidden to the pool instead of being freed/re-created. The limits are 28 beams and 10 ring bursts; overflow is counted and only a cosmetic effect is dropped.
- The live diagnostics panel reports active effects, beam/ring pool capacities and dropped cosmetic effects alongside FPS, frame p95 and draw-call counters.
- The Godot headless runtime smoke test exercises aim-facing/gait/recoil, beam reuse, ring expansion/fade, object reuse and the new diagnostics fields.


## Release 0.7 — hit-confirmation and elimination feedback

- Confirmed hits now flash the primary armor shell white for 140 ms, pop it slightly in scale, and show a compact floating −1 label which eases upward and fades over 520 ms. The readout is created once per guard and reused on subsequent hits instead of spawning a new UI node per shot.
- Eliminations now trigger a pooled ring burst, a brief white impact particle burst and a restrained camera impulse; elite Warden kills use a stronger amber response. Existing bounded ring and particle budgets still cap cosmetic allocations.
- Godot runtime smoke now checks the actual hit label, live feedback timers, armor flash/scale, and pooled elimination effect in the combat loop.


## Release 0.8 — tactical radar HUD

- Added a GDScript-drawn live minimap to the Godot HUD on desktop. It projects the real 3D arena coordinates into a compact tactical map, including cover, security gate, three phase conduits and their live safe/warning/active states.
- The radar reads live player, guard archetype, destructible-device, terminal, quantum-core, extraction and medkit state. Objective markers update as the mission progresses, with distinct colours for Warden, Heavy, Stalker and Ranger contacts.
- The radar hides automatically for compact/touch layouts so it cannot compete with movement/action pads or the objective strip. It uses local data and redraws at a bounded 8.3 Hz.
- The headless runtime smoke validates world-to-map boundaries, coordinate clamping, hazard colours and wiring to live combat data.


## Release 0.9 — objective compass and Godot-first launch

- The OSGARD portal and both entertainment catalogues now launch the Godot 4.7.2 build by default. The previous lightweight browser build remains available as a compatibility fallback from the Godot launch shell.
- Added a live objective compass to the Godot HUD. It projects the active mission node through the current camera, smoothly rotates the arrow, shows measured in-game distance, and switches from terminal to quantum core to extraction as objectives are completed.
- When the operator reaches an objective, the compass changes to a direct interaction prompt. The same responsive HUD supports desktop and compact/touch layouts.
- Runtime smoke tests exercise all mission stages and guard the compass direction against invalid values. CI installs the official Godot 4.7.2 engine and matching single-threaded web export templates, runs headless gameplay tests, exports the WebAssembly/PCK build and verifies published routes.


## Release 1.0 — cinematic camera and directional damage readability

- Godot remains the primary NULL SHIFT runtime. The repository CI installs Godot 4.7.2 and web export templates, runs headless gameplay smoke, exports the browser build and checks the released routes; no local installation is required just to publish changes.
- Added smooth camera FOV breathing: movement adds a restrained 1.35° response, firing recoil adds up to 0.85°, and NULL SHIFT temporarily adds 3.1°. Exponential easing avoids abrupt zoom cuts.
- Guard-originated hits show a directional damage arrow on the HUD edge. The direction is projected from the actual attacking 3D node through the camera, fades over 0.62 seconds, reflects remaining health and hides while blocking menus/pause cover play. Environmental phase-lane damage remains distinct because it has no attacker direction.
- Headless runtime smoke checks exercise the FOV widen/return and verify that a real damaging hit creates and expires the directional marker.
- This is engine-native gameplay/UI work, not native 8K output. The Web build remains constrained by browser/GPU support and uses the Compatibility renderer for broad reach.


## Release 1.1 — animated security gate

- The security gate now has procedural jambs, red/cyan lock indicators and a local status light that pulses red while locked and transitions to cyan after a successful cipher.
- A correct code disables collision immediately, then animates the gate upward with a cubic-eased Tween over 780 ms before hiding it. That gives a clear physical response while preventing the operator from getting trapped during the animation.
- Headless Godot runtime smoke covers the visible opening state, immediate collision deactivation, upward movement, final hidden state and lock-indicator colour change. The mechanism uses engine-created geometry and no downloaded runtime assets.


## Release 1.2 — responsive cinematic vignette

- Added a first-party CanvasItem shader layer under the HUD. A soft, restrained vignette anchors the screen edges without obscuring objective text, mobile controls or the reticle.
- The vignette reads live health and NULL SHIFT phase state. Low vitality increases the edge contrast and shifts it toward a subdued danger tint; activating the phase shift blends in a restrained violet edge treatment. Cinematic, auto-optimized and balanced profiles set different baseline strengths.
- The feature is generated by GDScript and a small shader string. It uses no textures, downloaded art, remote scripts or extra assets. Its runtime smoke test confirms the real shader layer exists, does not capture input, and reacts to critical health/phase activation.
- This is an in-engine post-process-like screen treatment for the Compatibility renderer, not a substitute for shadow maps, imported art or native 8K output.


## Release 1.3 — startup-layout and deterministic target-lock verification

- Hardened responsive layout against the early startup frame where a headless/browser viewport or HUD element may not yet be valid. The layout controller now waits until the HUD hierarchy exists and the viewport has a usable size before changing panel anchors.
- Stabilized the headless target-lock test by pointing the test camera at the test hostile before projecting the eight-corner marker, then restoring the camera transform. This prevents the assertion from depending on incidental camera smoothing or test viewport geometry.
- These guards improve startup robustness and make the runtime test exercise the actual lock UI rather than an uncontrolled camera pose.


## Release 1.4 — idempotent target-lock HUD

- Made target-lock construction idempotent. If the UI setup routine runs again, it no longer appends another copy of the eight corner pieces or creates a second marker tree; the tracked array is reset before first construction.
- The headless runtime test retains the deterministic camera pose and asserts one visible target lock made of exactly eight corners, with live identity and health.

- Follow-up hardening: made the whole HUD builder idempotent, preventing duplicated CanvasLayers or accumulators if setup is re-entered. Collection arrays are reset only when a fresh HUD is constructed.


## Release 1.5 — per-instance mutable state isolation

- Each Godot game instance now allocates fresh runtime arrays and dictionaries in `_ready()`. This avoids accumulated references across repeated scene instances, test harnesses or scene reloads, including guard/device lists, effect pools, phase HUD chips, operator pivots, mobile controls and target-lock corners.
- The runtime smoke checks still require exactly three phase-lane indicators and exactly eight target-lock corners; the source-contract test now guards the per-instance collection reset explicitly.


## Release 1.6 — isolate reference-backed runtime state

- Fixed the root cause of duplicated phase HUD-chip references: GDScript Arrays and Dictionaries are reference-backed, and assigning empty literal defaults did not reliably isolate multiple scene instances in the headless runtime harness. Every transient array/dictionary is now duplicated before being cleared and reused by a fresh game instance.
- Removed temporary phase-HUD debug printing. The runtime smoke retains the strict requirement of exactly three live phase-lane labels and exactly eight target-lock corner pieces.


## Release 1.7 — fix HUD lifecycle placement

- Moved the complete HUD construction body back into `_create_ui()`. The vignette shader's frame update now only updates shader parameters; it no longer constructs the status panel, phase chips, utility controls or objective HUD every frame.
- This fixes the root cause of phase labels accumulating across frames and prevents repeated allocation of interactive UI controls. Static smoke checks function boundaries and fails if HUD creation is accidentally nested in a per-frame shader update.

- Follow-up integrity fix: HUD construction no longer clears the operator's pre-built leg-pivot list. Those pivots are created in the gameplay rig before the HUD is built, and clearing them in UI setup silently disabled the procedural walking gait.
